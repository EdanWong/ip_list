# Malicious and Unwanted IP Address List

This repository provides a curated list of IP addresses associated with malicious activities, adult (pornographic) content, and online gambling platforms. The purpose of this list is to serve as a reference for individuals, organizations, and network administrators who wish to implement IP-based blocking to protect users and systems from harmful or unwanted content.

## üìå Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

- To identify and publish IP addresses known to be involved in:
  - Malware distribution
  - Phishing and other cyber threats
  - Pornographic content hosting
  - Online gambling operations
- To provide a freely available reference list for network filtering and firewall configurations
- To help promote a safer and more controlled internet environment

## üõ°Ô∏è Usage

This list can be used to:

- Block malicious traffic at the firewall level
- Filter content in DNS servers
- Restrict access to pornographic and gambling-related IPs on public or private networks

Please ensure that you regularly update your local copy of the list, as the threat landscape changes frequently.
